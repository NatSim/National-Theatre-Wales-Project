<h1>Go Tell The Bees-App</h1>

This Project is called **Got Tell The Bees** and is a responsive web application to go alongside a site-specific show for **National Theatre Wales** . This app uses **React Framework**.

## Project Structure

The structure of the repository is:

- README.md
- client
- server

### client
**Javascript code using React Framework.**

### server
**Node.js** code here.

###The Database
**Mongo Database**

### Start The Development Server

You can start the client side code (front-end), server side (back-end) and database separately using the commands in their respective folders. If you prefer to start all three together (this is the most convienient way), you can do so with the following commands:

1. `npm install && npm install --prefix client`
2. `npm run develop`

Please note that you run `npm install && npm install --prefix client` during your first installation, subsequently you will only need to run `npm run develop` to get your development environment up and running
### Example Application

If all's well with the above steps, you should see a list of example data. If your browser shows a "No users found" message, re-check all the steps.
### Start Instructions

To start the client:
Run `npm start` in command line.

Start the server:
`npm run develop`
