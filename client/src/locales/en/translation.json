    "description2":"The nation of Wales is our stage.Collaborate. Make. Inspire. We collaborate with people and places to make extraordinary theatre that inspires change. From the intimate to the epic, our work is powerful, brave and unexpected. National Theatre Wales has been making English-language productions in locations all over Wales, the UK, internationally and online since March 2010. It operates from a small base in Cardiff’s city centre, but works all over the country and beyond, using Wales’ rich and diverse landscape, its towns, cities and villages, its incredible stories and rich talent as its inspiration. National Theatre Wales is supported by the Welsh Government and the Arts Council of Wales."

  "We all know that act's of kindness can make someone's day but in our busy lives we can sometimes miss the opportunity. So it might help to make some plans. A regular check in on an elderly neighbour? An invite to share a meal? Or perhaps you can join a voluntary programme that can make helping others part of your weekly routine? The challenges we face as individuals and as a society can feel overwhelming but starting small, with things we know can make a difference, we can always be part of the solution.",

"text2":
  "Acts of kindness are often accompanied by emotional warmth. Emotional warmth produces the hormone, oxytocin, therefore kindness can be said to be cardioprotective - being kind really can help your heart!",
