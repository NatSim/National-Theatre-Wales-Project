      "We all know that acts of kindness can make someone's day but in our busy lives we can sometimes miss the opportunity. So it might help to make some plans. A regular check in on an elderly neighbour? An invite to share a meal? Or perhaps you can join a voluntary programme that can make helping others part of your weekly routine? The challenges we face as individuals and as a society can feel overwhelming but starting small, with things we know can make a difference, will can always be part of the solution.",

      "Did you know that acts of kindness are often accompanied by emotional warmth. Emotional warmth produces the hormone, oxytocin, therefore kindness can be said to be cardioprotective - being kind really can help your heart!",

It's easy for us to get trapped in our habits and what we know, but trying something different can bring new perspectives and refresh our thinking. Volunteering could be another route to make new connections, alongside others in common cause or helping people who can also, it turns out, help you. Or learn a new skill, perhaps something you had never thought you would do, and find that you connect with new people too.",

When we consider the stars we are reminded of our connection to each other as well as our connection to our ancestors – after all, if you want to look back in time, all you have to do is look up.",

      "We over-consume because we are encouraged to do so. Ever since the rise of the advertising industry in the 50s, we’ve been told that we need more and more stuff. Nowadays in order to ‘keep the economy going’.Yes, we all like to go shopping and sometimes even just for the sheer joy of experiencing something new. But so many t-shirts, plastic toys and 2-for-1 deals? How gratifying it is to go back to making, reusing, sharing and swapping. Borrowing books and tools from libraries; Growing some of our own food. Doing all this does not only make us feel better about ourselves, with more friends and skills. But it also helps us save cash and bank precious time to then spend with family, friends and in nature.",
