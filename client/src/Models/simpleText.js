      "We all know that acts of kindness can make someone's day but in our busy lives we can sometimes miss the opportunity. So it might help to make some plans. A regular check in on an elderly neighbour? An invite to share a meal? Or perhaps you can join a voluntary programme that can make helping others part of your weekly routine? The challenges we face as individuals and as a society can feel overwhelming but starting small, with things we know can make a difference, will always be part of the solution.",
