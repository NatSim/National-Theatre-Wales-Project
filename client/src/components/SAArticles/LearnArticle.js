          Imagine if you had a teacher as awe-inspiring and wise as Nature. The
          one who could help you find knowledge and wonder in the everyday.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rediscover your curiosity and adventurousness Improve your well-being.
          Show you the importance of respect and humility.
        </p>
        <p>
          The teacher who could tell you crazy things that bend your mind, like
          that there are more trees on Earth than stars in the Milky Way. Or
          that giraffes are predominantly gay. Or that ocean is a home to nearly
          95% of all life.
