          We all know that acts of kindness can make someoneâ€™s day but in our
          busy lives we can sometimes miss the opportunity. So it might help to
          make some plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          The challenges we face as individuals and as a society can feel
          overwhelming but starting small, with things we know can make a
          difference, will always be part of the solution.

          A regular check in on an elderly neighbour? An invite to share a meal?
          Or perhaps you can join a voluntary programme that can make helping
          others part of your weekly routine?
