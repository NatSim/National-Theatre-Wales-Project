        From mythical stories to prophetic signs; from navigational tools to an
        exploration of our place in the universe, we humans have long known that
        the stars are an important part of our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every single atom in our bodies was once inside a star that exploded. We
        are – all of us – made of stardust. We think that is a beautiful and
        incredible thing. When we consider the stars we are reminded of our
        connection to each other as well as our connection to our ancestors –
        after all, if you want to look back in time, all you have to do is look
        up.
