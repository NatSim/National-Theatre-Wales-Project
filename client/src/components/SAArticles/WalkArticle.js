        Ever wondered what happens to you when you take a walk in nature, when
        your feet start feeling the ground underneath and when the sound of wind
        in leaves reaches your brain?
      </p>
      <p>
        Trees secrete phytoncides, the olfactory-provoking chemicals that reduce
        stress hormones. Which means that the effect of the walk is that it
        reduces your anxiety; but also that it improves your immunity and
        memory; fortifies you against flue and colds; makes you fitter and
        happier. The list goes on. And if you do it again and again, research
        says, the benefits grow into a true medicinal marvel. So, shall we?
