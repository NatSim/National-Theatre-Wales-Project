        We overconsume because we are encouraged to do so. Ever since the rise
        of the advertising industry in the 50s, we’ve been told that we need
        more and more stuff. Nowadays in order to ‘keep the economy going’.

        Yes, we all like to go shopping and sometimes even just for the sheer
        joy of experiencing something new. But so many t-shirts, plastic toys
        and 2-for-1 deals?
      </p>

        How gratifying it is to go back to making, re-using, sharing and
        swapping. Borrowing books and tools from libraries; Growing some of our
        own food.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doing all this does not only make us feel better about ourselves, with
        more friends and skills. But it also helps us save cash and bank
        precious time to then spend with family, friends and in nature.
