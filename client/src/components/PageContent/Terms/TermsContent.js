          11.1 All persons must be in possession of a valid Ticket and proof of
          identity to gain entry to the relevant performance. 11.2 We will
          endeavour to seat latecomers at a suitable break in the performance,
          as judged by our staff. However, please note that this may not be
          until the first interval. In exceptional circumstances and depending
          on the performance, we may be unable to admit latecomers at all.
          Please therefore make every effort to attend performances in plenty of
          time. 11.3 Due to the site-located nature of many National Theatre
          Wales productions, we are no able to admit dogs or other animals onto
          the performance site, other than those who may feature in the
          production or assistance dogs.

          charities. 2. How much is Gift Aid worth? For every £1 you give to
          National Theatre Wales, we can reclaim 25p from the tax you’ve paid to
          the Inland Revenue. 3. I’m not sure if I am eligible for Gift Aid. How
          do I find out? You are eligible for Gift Aid if you… Pay tax on your
          pension Pay income tax Pay capital gains tax You must pay an amount of
          Income Tax and/or Capital Gains Tax for each tax year that is at least
          equal to the amount of tax that National Theatre Wales, and any other
