        National Theatre Wales is committed to furthering accessibility, to its
        work, itâ€™s workforce and to the sector as a whole. We ensure along every
        step of our journey that we remain physically accessible, taking care
        and consideration when choosing sites and venues for our work. With
        site-located work this may be a challenge, but one accepted willingly.
        We have and continue to program for our shows BSL, Audio Described, Live
        Speech to text, Dementia Friendly and Relaxed Performances and have even
        developed our own system for captioning on i-Pads. This system has been
        provided free to companies across Wales resulting in not just a larger
        array of captioned theatre across Wales, but also influencing other
        companies to follow suit. We work closely with organisations such as
        Disability Arts Cymru and have also set up a quarterly Access Forum that
        brings together organisations, artists, participants and public to
        discuss ways to make the sector more inclusive. The access forum is
        continuing to grow and build its network with forums being planned
        across Wales. For more information on this please email:
